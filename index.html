      <p class="full">
        To begin a discussion on the role of the cut in the geometric abstractions of Eugenio Espinoza, a key practitioner in Venezuelan art since the 1970s, we ought to point out the most obvious of facts first, namely that a technique of scissoring is above all anchored in a dynamic between the hand and the eye.

          The cut in postwar art functions as a space forming device, limiting the ability of the pictorial to function illusionistically. It is impossible to discuss the cut in art and not consider the slashed monochrome canvases from the <em>Concetto spaziale</em> series by Argentine-Italian artist Lucio Fontana from the 1950s, executed with a knife. New York-based minimalist sculptor Carl Andre famously elaborated on the role of the cut as an instrument for acquiring spatial knowledge in 1966, observing that “Up to a certain time I was cutting into things. Then I realized that the thing I was cutting was the cut. Rather than cut into the material, I now use the material as the cut in space.” Andre, cited after David Bourdon, “The Razed Sites of Carl Andre,” <em>Artforum</em> 5, no. 2 (October 1966): 17. Espinoza’s approach to space forming by cutting is an extension of this historical legacy but he neither subscribes to a gesture of destruction nor a literalist definition of materiality in art in its embrace of chance, spontaneity, innate material behavior, and gestural activity by hand.

        What is at issue in the popular twentieth century paradigm of geometric abstraction is a freedom of experimentation with simple geometry, color, gestural application, material and texture choices, alongside an ordering of spatial relationships between various compositional parts—as well as an activation of the physical “reality” of surrounding space.

          In the growing literature on Espinoza, the artist is repeatedly cited regarding his exposure to a wide range of twentieth century traditions of geometric abstraction including French cubism, Dutch neoplasticism, Russian suprematism and constructivism, American minimalism, Italian arte povera, Venezuelan optical and kinetic art. In one of his most recent interviews, in 2021 the artist noted that “Then, in art books, I saw the paintings of Piet Mondrian, and later the works of Gego, Jesús Rafael Soto, and Alejandro Otero. I also saw the grid everywhere, even in sociopolitical systems of control. When I first started to paint, I did not want to work with any form of representation. The inspiration I received from Venezuelan artists such as Gego, but also from those abroad including Lucio Fontana and Piero Manzoni, convinced me to choose the grid.” Espinoza, cited after Madeline Murphy Turner, “Off the Grid: A Conversation with Eugenio Espinoza,” May 26, 2021, <a href="https://www.moma.org/magazine/articles/571">https://www.moma.org/magazine/articles/571</a>. He also encounters white modular minimalistic sculptures with black shapes in <em>Luz y transformación</em>, the second group show of the local Expansionismo group at the Ateneo de Caracas in October of 1967, with by Omar Carreño, Álvaro Sotillo, and Ruben Marquez. Phone interview with this author, May 20, 2022. A discussion of the semiotic nature of each of these artwork references is beyond the scope of this essay.

        Espinoza would choose unprimed canvas, square or grid figure, painted black bands, the shaping of “empty” space, and gestural activity by hand left visible to the discerning eye as the key formal parameters of operation for his art of variation.

          <span >^</span>
          As a historical reference serves the <em>Black Square</em> by Kazimir Malevich, 1915. Espinoza asserts that he “was very interested in what Malevich said about the square [and emptiness in art], that it was a perfect shape that contained everything.” Espinoza, in “Calculated Disorder: Eugenio Espinoza in Conversation with René Morales,” <em>Eugenio Espinoza: Unruly Supports</em> (1970-1980), ed. Fuenmajor (exhibition catalogue Pérez Art Museum, Miami: 2015), 132. Unprimed canvas and emptiness in abstraction have a place in Venezuelan art history. The early landscapes of Armando Reverón between 1926 and 1934 rely prominently on coarse unprimed canvas and burlap to invoke the local specificity of Macuto. Alejandro Otero’s seminal <em>Pince et carré blanc</em> (Brush and White Square), 1963, explores the effects of empty space by hanging an “empty” white square picture frame on a white wall side by side with a brush, both are covered in white enamel paint.

        In Espinoza’s most recent 2022 series, titled <em>Onceptuales</em>, the cut does double duty. It functions as a technique to bring figure into being and it acts as a cutout, charging that which is absent with pictorial presence. <span class="fig">(See Figure 1)</span> To take a case in point, <em>Onceptual #3</em> is assembled from coarsely cut canvas bands with frayed edges, glued together, with painted black fronts and unprimed backs poking noticeably into the foreground. Pictorial depth—understood as the optical distance between the canvas cells and the painted lattice with three-inch-thick black acrylic bands—is at a minimum. From a side view, the grid of nine square cells showcases an irregular undulating armature at a variable, impossible to measure depth of about seven inches. The bent canvases from this series transfigure the right-angle grid symbolic of the domain of abstract human thought (the precision and stability of the grid exists in this orthogonal purity only on the two-dimensional x and y axis of Cartesian geometry) into the changing y dimension of three-dimensional space. The gestural exertion of different kinds of physical pressure onto the painted figure leads to a signatory stylistic look generally described by the artist and others as a distortion or deformation or unhinging of the orderly, right-angle appearance of simple geometry.

        Seminal Venezuelan art critic Lourdes Blanco turns to a canvas as body metaphor to capture the elusive physical appearance of these works at odds with previous approaches to geometric abstraction as pseudo-organic entities that are “living media—torn, unraveled and swollen.”

        A metaphor as a figure of speech describes an object or a person in a way that is not literally true by linking it to something else by analogy. Art history offers up yet another semiotic explanation, one which does not rely on visual surface similarity to capture the important role of gestural activity in Espinoza’s geometric abstractions. Mark making in art are the dripping lines, coarse patterns, and textures of a thick horsehair brush or a ripped tear and frayed cut that are left visible by the artist as a trace, a manifestation of the physical presence of the artist in the act of making. The cut, which exemplifies the reciprocal interaction of the body and the world that is the condition of visual artmaking, is directly caused by a body part, just like an imprint in snow is the result of a person’s feet imprinting it.

        One interesting feature of Espinoza’s employment of the cut is its capacity to sustain dual references to space occupancy as both a gestural and a perceptual task, albeit accomplished by different forms of semiotic reference.

        Three nesting squares in white acrylic on canvas form a diagonal line across, reaching from the lower left corner to the upper right-hand side of a saggy and malleable three-by-three black lattice structure. The double absence of wooden support stretcher and picture frame allow the cut to function as a plastic and pictorial tool for space creation. In a flash of perceptual ambiguity, we might experience a momentary confusion as to how many painted white cells are physically there versus how many fields are animated pictorially by the white wall behind it. The cutouts in their concurrent positive and negative appearance jeopardize, albeit momentarily, firm figure-ground attribution.

      <!-- <div></div> -->
      
      <p class="full"> 
        A perceptual ambiguity emerges that triggers intellectual curiosity concerning our understanding of how figure-ground attributions play out in this canvas, and in everyday life in general. The cutout in its joint role as either figure or ground alludes to some basic (intuitively experienced) features of perceptual space such as positional relations of in front and behind or figure and ground interaction on planar surfaces. By doing so, an awareness of the mental construction of perception sets it, and the cut now operates as a rhetorical device with some epistemic power as the painting exemplifies the basic everyday dynamic of human perception, the Gestaltist figure-ground relation through which we isolate a figure intentionally in an act of intuitive awareness from a surrounding space. This is based on how the cut enables physical space—the white wall surrounding the lattice and the expanse opened up by the cutouts—to become significant in optical terms. In abstract art, blankness supported by continuity can effect a dialectical reversal: space that is “empty” becomes saturated with associations.

        Much of twentieth century geometric abstraction has been preoccupied with the implications of treating a painting as-if it were an object in space, and Espinoza’s thematization of space occupancy is an extension of this modernist tradition. After all, we get access to space by moving through it, perceiving it. Consequently, notions of space in constructivist and minimalist sculpture are derived from painting, and geometric abstract art since Kazimir Malevich and Piet Mondrian has alluded to the qualities of sense perception (such as mass, volume, shape, positional relations of in front of and behind) as “foci of attention for their own sake, rather than as factors encountered simply as aspects of our everyday practical dealings with the modern world.”

Krešimir Purgar (New York and London: Routledge, 2020), 108-109. In most general terms, abstract art can be taken to allude to biological processes in nature, internal states, feelings, the workings of perception, or general states of mind. Crowther bases his notion of the transperceptual on Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s famous discussion of Paul Cézanne’s paintings and their ability to visualize the invisible in his 1964 “Eye and Mind” essay. See Maurice Merleau-Ponty, <em>The Primacy of Perception</em>, ed. James M. Edie, trans. Carleton Dallery (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1964.) This author is indebted to Jesús Fuenmajor who links Espinoza’s 1972 works to Merleau-Ponty’s writings on how Cezanne’s paints perception itself by foregrounding how figure-ground relations operate. See Fuenmajor, “Eugenio Espinoza: Unruly Supports (1970-1980),” in <em>Eugenio Espinoza: Unruly Supports</em> (1970-1980), ed. Fuenmajor (exhibition catalogue Pérez Art Museum, Miami: 2015), 22.

        The abstract works in the constructivist tradition allude to space-formation as a mental, transperceptual activity by association, and this provides an important gateway onto the subject matter of geometric abstraction.

        More to the point, British philosopher Paul Crowther explains that all perception is transperceptual built on complex mental processes of attention, selection, and association. “What we see is not a mere datum. Our recognition of it is based on its fitting with a horizon of visual expectations, constraints, and associations which are usually not noticed explicitly,” and Crowther concludes, “this comes to stand for the emergence of different “contextual spaces of expectation,”

        several of which can occur side by side in a single work of art. Frequently in Espinoza’s abstractions, an inability to see clearly, to see everything all at once, or with full certainty, serve as tactics to throw a wedge into automatic perceptual orientation, alluding to the transperceptual grounding of perception in mental processes.

          In Espinoza’s <em>Circunstantial (12 cocos)</em>, 1971, a grid canvas is suspended from the ceiling like a hammock, hiding a dozen coconuts placed inside it from view. Many canvases from the Museo de Bellas Artes show in 1972 do not reveal the physical causes for their deformation (such as sand tucked away by sewn canvas pockets.) His well-known <em>Impenetrable</em> at the Ateneo de Caracas in 1972 features a large grid canvas with a right-angle L shape that is placed about 30 inches above the floor as it reaches from wall to wall. Walking access is denied, and perceptual access is purposefully restrained by a single door so that the full L-shape is not accessible to sight.

          <span >^</span>
          This essay expands upon Crowther’s definition of the “phenomenological depth” of painting and its potential to foreground how the general structure of perception is subject to “contextual expectations” to include a discussion of allusion as a literary device of single artwork reference when one artwork refers to another. An artwork previously perceived and studied can recede into the transperceptual background as a new contextual frame of reference. Espinoza’s <em>Impenetrable</em> installation is based on an overt historical allusion to the playful, immersive, and participatory <em>Penetrable</em> installation of kinetic art pioneer Jesús Rafael Soto, exhibited at the Museo de Bellas Artes in 1971. The work is commonly read as an inversion, subversion, or critique of Soto’s work. See, for example, Juan Carlos Palenzuela, Arte en Venezuela: 1959-1979 (Caracas: Banco Mercantil, 2005), 153-156.

        As an artistic device of verbal and visual reference, allusions create more or less direct or indirect associations in a work of art to a place, event, person, or prior work of art. To make this clear, to allude to another work of art is not to depict it (or to imitate) but to refer to it by means of association.

        In psychology, mental association is a broad concept interpreted in general terms as a process in which a specific source is called upon by memory or imagination. Starting from perception and stemming from specific experience, in acts of association one image, object, or idea is linked to another, with the latter coinciding with the former in one or more aspects of similarity, opposition, or continguity.

Pancha distinguishes between three different kinds of association connecting percept and ideas: association by similarity (through strong visual resemblance), by contrast (with a weak resemblance), and by contiguity (if B has always been perceived together with A, or immediately after it, then the perception of the idea of A will revive the idea of B.)

          Cultural writer and anthropologist Néstor García Canclini brings this to a point when he writes that conventional linear temporality (which views postmodernity replacing modernity, which, in turn, replaces tradition) is undone when viewed from the perspective of Latin America. Instead, he argues for a “multitemporal heterogeneity” generated out of the contradictions between modernism and modernization endured with regional differences. See Néstor García Canclini, “Modernity after Postmodernity,” in <em>Beyond the Fantastic: Contemporary Art Criticism from Latin America</em>, ed. Gerardo Mosquera (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1996), 28. Art, in Canclini’s view, absorbs the conflictual structure of society, including its dependence on foreign models, aiming at a transformation of these structures from within the semiotic ability of art to communicate. Suffice it to state here that Espinoza’s position in this context requires further elaboration.

        While it has generally been accepted that this era of modernist inquiry into the nature of experience has come to an end in U.S. and Europe in the 1960s, the practice of Espinoza productively complicates this timeline in its continued insistence on the phenomenological depth of painting as a gateway onto the allusive nature of the mind. Espinoza’s canvases, we might conclude, explore the full potential of the allusive nature of abstraction by opening contextual spaces of expectation beyond the transperceptual.

          Not finding any of the established 1960s Venezuelan traditions of informalist, kinetic, or optical abstraction rewarding, Espinoza began looking toward the wider history of art. Briefly, to find a way out of established traditions of Latin American art (kineticism, magic realism, figuration), Espinoza visited the library at the Museo de Bellas Artes frequently in the late 1960s to look at art books and journals. Miguel Arroyo, then director of the museum, was known for his internationalist exhibition program featuring movements such as pop art, arte povera, minimalism, and postminimalism during the mid-to late 1960s. Clara Diament Sujo, director of the art gallery Estudio Actual (founded in 1968), frequently travelled to New York, bringing Artforum and other U.S. magazines back. Espinoza mentions that he had access to <em>Artforum</em> for visual stimulation without reading it. Phone interview with the artist, May 10, 2022.

        Two things are especially noteworthy in <em>Onceptual #9</em>. First, we encounter a jarring discrepancy between what we see and what is physically there that jeopardizes a viewing experience of perceptual automation. Measuring 48 by 73 inches, <em>Onceptual #9</em> is, in fact, a rectangle. To the naked eye, however, its shape appears to be that of a square. This contradiction between the numerical information of the “real” canvas size and what we perceive it to be, yet again, alludes to the transperceptual nature of perception. Set in the context of the Gestalist rules of psychology, size is an absolute value, but shape is contingent on perception; they can be two entirely different values. Second, <em>Onceptual #9</em> presents a conscious formal variation of a canvas from 1971, exhibited at the artist’s seminal <em>20 Obras recientes</em> solo show at the Museo de Bellas Artes in Caracas in the summer of 1972. <span class="fig">(Figure 4)</span>

        The basic armature of both paintings is a lattice structure of eight noticeably absent squares held together by a single white rectangle in the center. Self-reference (considered a special form of historical allusion) has been elevated by Espinoza to a point of method since the 1970s. Critic Ruth Auerbach specifically noted that “the appropriation of his own work, shifting time and place, is perhaps Eugenio Espinoza’s most determined and conceptual undertaking.”

        </span>  
        Rather than considering permutational variation in painting an act of appropriation, like Auerbach suggests, we might consider it a form of reference when the new work has a new body, alluding to the former work selectively by taking over some formal parameters while varying others. The historic work features a wooden bar at the top and one at the bottom to provide structural stability: the bunching of the soft fabric canvas that wraps around the hard support creates vertical wave-like sagging that affects the entire inner compositional order. This is very unlike the soft, sagging armature of <em>Onceptual #9</em>, mostly caused by a method of suspension from four equidistant hooks. Whereas the earlier canvases from the 1970s feature a more or less solid weighty physicality, space occupancy in the <em>Onceptuales</em> series impresses us no less viscerally as an equilibrium of opposing forces arrested in motion: absence and presence, balance and virtual motion, gravity and the suspension of it animate the works from within.

        In <em>Onceptual #010</em> and <em>#72</em>, fabric even more forcefully collapses in onto itself by the force of its own weight, gravity, and the laws of space in general. Instead of identical square cells forming a grid, these felt works feature two rectangular rows that sit atop of each other. Reinforced by the cast shadows, a curvilinear pattern of sorts moves from left to right. <span class="fig">(Figure 5)</span>

        The artist has bent shape by hand into wave-like undulations. Simultaneously, motion is implied virtually as an optical effect that exists only in the viewer’s eye-brain response. The hooks themselves are form-giving <em>and</em> have become figure as many are freed from their function as the primary tools of suspension. The dependence on the nail, and the subsequent gravity-bound deformation of the material, is reminiscent of American process art, albeit only superficially.

        In American process art of the late 1960s and early 1970s, the gestural activities that form the sculptural material during production are not hidden but remain a prominent element of the final work. The idea of foregrounding the process of making—with the appearance of shape as the joint result of the artist’s activity, the type and physical behavior of the materials employed, and the choice of display method—is said to be initiated by the drip paintings of Jackson Pollock in the early 1950s. Shifting process art into the format of sculpture in the late 1960s, postminimalist process artist Robert Morris made long cuts into rectangular pieces of industrial felt, hanging them onto a nail. Morris allows gravity and the innate properties of the material to create a formless entity independent of the artist’s aesthetic interests who purposefully gave up on controlling compositional order. Pollock’s point was that, rather than depict a figure, the irrational forces of the psyche alongside the rhythmic movements of the body, leave gravity-bound traces on the canvas, bringing him in sync with nature. Echoing Serra’s exploration of physics, but with a different aesthetic and intellectual take on form and nature as a form giving and destabilizing forces, Espinoza asserts that “being close to the laws of gravity, stones, and other elements” was of primary importance as a reflection on the tension between life in the metropolitan city of Caracas under modernization.

          Espinoza, quoted after <em>Eugenio Espinoza: Retro/retrospectiva 2016-1973</em> (exhibition catalogue Fundación Saludarte, Wecksler Publishing, Tenerife: 2017), 21. We might read Espinoza’s project as a reintegration of nature into city life and order that functions simultaneously as a territorial rebalancing. Historian John W. Lombardi has concluded that “the close connection between man and land in the Venezuelan context” has been “weakened by the dissolving power of technology and wealth” almost exclusively concentrated on the political and economic capital of Caracas since the mid-eighteenth century. See John W. Lombardi, <em>Venezuela: The Search for Order: The Dream of Progress</em> (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1982), 8, 10.
        </span> 
        Espinoza’s strategy, as it has been developed since the early 1970s, has been to explore the artist’s space-bound state as a way to deform a figure (in his case, the square order of simple geometry) by harnessing the gestural activities of the hand in tandem with both industrial and tropical materials such as sand, coconuts, or palm. (Venezuela is bound by the Caribbean Sea to the north.) Born in San Juan de los Morros situated in the southern slopes of the mountainous central highlands, Espinoza came to Caracas late in 1966 as a young adult to attend the Escuela de Artes Plásticas Cristóbal Rojas, and this shaped his immediate physical response to the city by seeking out the natural in all existence.

        Espinoza’s practice, not unlike the Italian arte povera project which was received well in Venezuela, nature is brought into art in the broadest sense, as it comprises the three-dimensional world and the micro and macro processes that govern both organic and industrial city reality by implicating art and observer into a dynamic process of subjective experience.

        Unlike arte povera art, Espinoza isolates a device of working with natural materials by means of historical allusion, entering it into an ever so complex web of associative reference that insist on the specificity of the local and the mental contingencies of space perception. The solicitation of a virtual movement also alludes to the local tradition of optical and kinetic art so pervasively present in the Venezuelan scene of the 1960s. Allusions, after all, tend to occur in bundles but with different contextual spaces of expectation associated with it: allusions to the transperceptual grounding of perception in Gestaltist psychology, self-reference, visual and verbal allusions to the history of art, among other realms.

          Supported by artist statements linking the grid to urban and social order, the ever-growing literature tends to interpret the deformed grid canvas as a metaphor for the failure of modernist architectural and urban renewal politics in Caracas associated with the public building projects of architect Carlos Raúl Villanueva for the Universidad central de Venezuela. This reading takes the canvases dialectical appearance of order and deformation, structure and chaos, as structurally homologues to the internal historical contradictions of modernization in Venezuela in the 1950s and 1960s. This standard reading of Espinoza’s work as a critique of Venezuelan urban and architectural modernization under the influence of international style art, geometric universalism, kinetic playfulness, and optical dematerialization, however, stands to be reevaluated in the context of a wider network of allusion to the grid in multiple historical and disciplinary contexts, including the history of art.

        The title of the series, <em>Onceptuales</em>, is hard to pronounce, almost concretist in sound quality. A strategy of perceptual disorientation also works in the context of language. It is impossible to make sense of its meaning unless we understand the word “onceptual” as a verbal allusion to a different historical context, the movement of conceptual art by slashing the letter “c” of the term conceptual. Conceptual art is a multi-facetted Anglophone invention. Given Espinoza’s proclivity for working with the simple geometry of the square in space, we might look toward the writings and white floor-based cube sculptures of Sol LeWitt to interpret this historical allusion.

        In his 1966 text “Paragraphs on Conceptual Art,” LeWitt famously wrote that the idea or concept is the most important part of a work of art whose execution is of secondary importance since everything is planned beforehand.

        He adds that the idea in art does not need to be complex but rather thrives on simplicity. Gestural activity is key in Espinoza, and the “idea” in Espinoza is not readily accessible but rather requires a heavy interpretive effort. And yet the verbal allusion has meaning as it thematizes in the most general terms how the perceptual and the conceptual as singled out properties of a work of art are brought into new kinds of alignment. Despite the obvious opposition between LeWitt and Espinoza, this overt historical allusion engages us in a string of thoughts on how Espinoza’s abstractions are “conceptual.”

          Juan Ledezma employs the writings of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari on the relation between sense and concept to grasp Espinoza’s rethinking of painting in the context of a realignment of the perceptual and conceptual in art. See Juan Ledezma, “Painting as Event,” in <em>Unruly Supports</em>, 95-99. Painting, Ledezma rightly notes, cannot be conceptual. In the experience of its physical appearance and formal make up, however, new concepts as “nomadic territories” can emerge in the response of the viewer.

        Long before the overt titling of the <em>Onceptuales</em> series, critics and artists have queried the work’s conceptual nature, starting in the late 1970s. To take one case in point, fellow Venezuelan artist Claudio Perna, arguably the generation’s artist who employs conceptual idioms in the most readily discernible way, stated retroactively in the 1990s that he thinks that “Eugenio Espinoza is one the great conceptual artists.”

        By shifting the plastic device of the cut into the realm of language, Espinoza has opened pandora’s box in the process on what conceptual art is, how it has been received in Latin America under the label of conceptualism, how an entire new 1970s generation in Venezuela has or has not defined itself as conceptual, and how the recent literature has come to assess what Venezuelan conceptualism stands for. Lastly, is there even such as a thing as a conceptual painting? This author will not go down this rabbit hole, at least not in this text, as this discussion deserves some serious attention beyond the scope of this essay. The answer to the question of the work’s conceptual nature, however, shall not completely be sidelined in this text either. To begin with, the answer depends on how we define what conceptual art is, and how conceptualism in Latin America not only operates in similar and different ways to the Anglophone movement but how we have to account for regional differences between different countries in the southern hemisphere. This line of questioning is indicative of how Espinoza’s allusive art repeatedly forces us to think about the intellectual presuppositions behind both the percepts and concepts of our understanding of art (and the world in general.)

        In discussions of Venezuelan art of the 1970s, much art in-between genre and media boundaries in the absence of a better style or movement term has been referred to as conceptual art, keeping the definition of Venezuelan conceptualism purposefully broadly defined.

          Blanco, “Recordando Sin Iras (Remembering Without Rancor),” 10. She notes that when genres are abolished, instability and chance become new paradigms. Following Blanco’s discussion, Manuel Ortega Navarro defines conceptual art in Venezuela in the broadest terms possible as “all art is conceptual, understanding that the plastic arts are not based only on pure visuality. Art is made by the human being and as such, has sensations, memories, prejudices, etc., that produce in the artistic work a result of his personal interpretation.” See Manuel Ortega Navarro, “Origen del arte conceptual en Venezuela,” <em>Situ Arte: Revista Arbitrada de la Facultad de Arte de la Universidad del Zulia</em> (año 1, no. 2, enero – junio  2007), 68, <a href="https://produccioncientificaluz.org/index.php/situarte/article/viewFile/15940/15913">https://produccioncientificaluz.org/index.php/situarte/article/viewFile/15940/15913</a>

        To put this differently, the more forcefully the cut solicits the associative power of “empty” space in the <em>Onceptuales</em> series, the closer the wall hung work moves toward the format of sculpture, posing in the process what defines each medium as a question. Since <em>Onceptual #010</em> and <em>#72</em> are fashioned from industrial black felt, color is disconnected here from paint and the activity of painting. In an addition to a realignment of the perceptual and the conceptual values of art, yet another conceptual idiom, the questioning of a work’s ontological status, emerges into view here. These two <em>Onceptuales</em> canvases only evoke the idea of painting by harnessing selected conventions associated with the medium of painting such as wall-hanging a rectangular item. Technically (factually), the work is a sculpture.

        To paraphrase the father of conceptual art, Marcel Duchamp and his famous question of how you can make an art without making art, Espinoza, it can be argued, shifts the discussion into the realm of media, asking “How can you make a painting without painting it?” Espinoza arrived at an anti-formalist reading of media in favor of a semiotic-communicative notion of art as a bundle of choices by studying the work of Venezuelan wire sculptor Gego. In an 8-page text written at the occasion of her seminal <em>Drawings without Paper</em> exhibition in 1986, Espinoza observes that “I understood everything immediately, when I saw that the ‘drawings’ [made from twisting wire into shape] did not occupy a sculptural space but the frontal space of the wall, like a hung painting. But they were really drawings; they were ‘truly real’ lines, you could touch them, and they were there to create a number of cleverly constructed spatial relationships.”

        The art historical assessment of what marks Venezuelan conceptualism is currently under way. The discussions tend to share a broad definition of this term to accommodate the wide range of divergent practices in the 1970s under one umbrella terms, ranging from an aforementioned dissolution of media specific boundaries to intensified participation in art (by hands-on activities or in an intensified, more open mental effort of making meaning), to an increased reliance on performance and performative measures.

          Miami-based critic Félix Suazo follows the contemporary writings of María Elena Ramos from 1981 informed by a McLuhanesque notion of communication to argue that any artwork that demonstrates “an explicit interest in the presence, participation and relationship with the viewer” as a vital element in the process of codifying and interpreting the work could be deemed conceptual. See Félix Suazo, “Prácticas conceptuales y micropolitíca del signo en Venezuela,” <em>Revista Kaypunktu: Revista de Estudios Interdisciplinarios de Arte y Cultura 1</em> (Diciembre 2014): 140-141. In an essay first published in 2008, Venezuelan scholar Gabriela Rangel employed Mexican-based Peruvian art critic Juan Acha’s 1981 notion of “non-objectual art” to designate the 70s turn toward hybrid and ephemeral art as one in which the body of the artist creates situations and performance as conceptual. See an easily accessible republication of this seminal essay, “An Art of Nook: Notes on Non-Objectual Experiences in Venezuela,” Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics, 2021, <a href="https://hemisphericinstitute.org/en/emisferica-81/8-1-essays/an-art-of-nooks-notes-on-non-objectual-experiences-in-venezuela.html">https://hemisphericinstitute.org/en/emisferica-81/8-1-essays/an-art-of-nooks-notes-on-non-objectual-experiences-in-venezuela.html</a>

        Espinoza can indeed be considered a key practitioner of Venezuelan conceptualism as his work subscribes to each of the defining characteristics currently at play in the critical literature. This kind of categorical attribution can be useful but only if it does not overshadow the specific nature of an individual practice.

        What stands out in Espinoza’s canvases is a dual emphasis on the phenomenological depth of painting and the allusive nature of abstraction as a biologically anchored and culturally contingent field of cultural expectations where one serves as a platform onto the other. One of the lessons to be learned here is that looking closer at what is actually there always functions as a gateway onto thinking deeper.
